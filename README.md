# Arctic Ice Analysis

This group project was part of the MSc in Computational Neuroscience at the University of Nottingham. It involves the analysis of Arctic ice data, including temperature, methane, and carbon dioxide levels, to understand the long-term trends in Arctic ice loss and its correlation with climate change. The project includes data preprocessing, linear regression, and time series analysis.

## Project Goal

To analyse Arctic ice data to identify significant trends and correlations that can provide insights into climate change and its impact on polar ice levels.

## Key Features

* **Time Series Analysis:** Analysis of long-term trends in Arctic ice levels.
* **Linear Regression Models:** Predictive models for forecasting ice loss.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and organizing raw climate data for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and correlations in the data.

## Usage

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and models:

```bash
jupyter notebook Preprocessing+linear_regression.ipynb
```
